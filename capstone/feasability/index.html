        <h1>Capstone Project: Feasability Report</h1>
        <h3>Important note</h3>
        <p>This feasability report is being written with the perspective that my personal goal of the project has changed. Some aspects of the capstone development process do not reflect this change of direction.</p>
        <h2>Planned Features</h2>
        <p>The project will feature an interactive image of Davis' Centennial Seal, using image maps and overlays to create a visual presentation of the seal's contents as the user hovers over and clicks on parts of the seal. This will be developed as a compliment to existing informative resources about it.</p>
        <h2>Required Technologies</h2>
        <p>The use of image maps will probably be the most complicated part of the project, as everything else is just in-depth use of the core features of CSS and Javascript. The use of databases and code libraries will not be neccessary but may be used if they provide a worthwhile feature to the experience.</p>
        <h2>Skill Assessment</h2>
        <p>After scaling back the scope of the project, this goal is much better alligned to my skill with these tools and will absolutely be possible within the given time.</p>
