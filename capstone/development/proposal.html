    <h1>Capstone Project Proposal</h1>

    <p>I plan to pursue one of the ideas I came up with on my own during the brainstorming activity and have my project be a game where people would match the symbols depicted on the seal with their intended meaning, eventually filling in the spaces of the seal to create the full image. The focus of the project is to educate people on the significance of the seal and its meaning through a simple game, with the likely age range for the target audience being from 13 to 18.</p>
    <p>I will be using the seal as a reference for illustrations to use for the project, since this would make it easier to achieve the visual effect of 'building the seal' as the player continued through the game. Rather than quizzing the player on the meaning of the seal, it would be presented as a game of "find the image that best fits this idea" and players would then browse a variety of symbols featured on the seal until they find the appropriate one.</p>
    <p>This idea is still in its early phases, so I will need to look into the seal in more detail to get a better idea for how to accomplish this.</p>
