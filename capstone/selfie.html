    <h2>Seal Selfie</h2>

    <p>After visiting the seal with a friend that was visiting me at the time, we both reflected on how much age was apparent on the seal, which contrasted the city that surrounded it. It felt like something that you would see in the older parts of the city of Davis, and yet it was just across from the local Starbucks. As an artifact that is supposed to symbolize the origin of the town, it's actually kind of fitting that it is located in one of the busiest parts of Davis.</p>
