        <h1>Capstone Project: Annotated Bibliography</h1>
<br>
        <h3>Source 1: UC Davis Centennial Website</h3>
        <a href="https://centennial.ucdavis.edu/index.html">The Regents of the University of California, Davis campus. UC Davis Centennial, 25 August 2011, https://centennial.ucdavis.edu/index.html. Accessed 9 May 2023.</a>

        <p>This is the official website for the Davis Centennial, which will be an invaluable resource for the tone and content of the project. While this will not be exactly identical to the style of content that my project will have, this is useful as a reference point for what is expected.</p>
<br>
        <h3>Source 2: Centennial Seal Arts and Culture Webpage</h3>
        <a href="https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/city-manager-s-office/arts-culture/davis-centennial-seal">Granicus. “Davis Centennial Seal.” City of Davis, City of Davis, 2023, https://www.cityofdavis.org/city-hall/city-manager-s-office/arts-culture/davis-centennial-seal. Accessed 9 May 2023.</a>

        <p>This is a website page published by the City of Davis that is a direct reference for the imagery of the seal and its meanings. Naturally, this is going to be one of my main resources for the project as this plays a significant role in my intended end goal. I will be looking back at this webpage often!</p>

        <h3>Source 3: IDEAH "Creating a Playable History" Article</h3>
        <a href="https://ideah.pubpub.org/pub/ipr99be2/release/2">Lawler, Jeffrey, and Sean Smith. “Creating a Playable History: Digital Games, Historical Skills and Learning.” IDEAH, 19 August 2021, https://ideah.pubpub.org/pub/ipr99be2/release/2. Accessed 9 May 2023.</a>

        <p>This is an article about classes at an institute that had an incredibly similar assignment to our own capstone project. Not only can this be useful to get an idea of how to approach my own project, it is also details how some students adressed difficult topics, which I may have to do for my own project.</p>
